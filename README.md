## Usage

The main executable for this project is `backhaul`. It requires a TOML configuration file for both the server and client components.

### Configuration Options

To start using the solution, you'll need to configure both server and client components. Here’s how to set up basic configurations:

* **Server Configuration**

   Create a configuration file named `config.toml`:

    ```toml
    [server]# Local, IRAN
    bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"    # Address and port for the server to listen on (mandatory).
    transport = "tcp"             # Protocol to use ("tcp", "tcpmux", or "ws", optional, default: "tcp").
    token = "your_token"          # Authentication token for secure communication (optional).
    keepalive_period = 20         # Interval in seconds to send keep-alive packets.(optional, default: 20 seconds)
    nodelay = false               # Enable TCP_NODELAY (optional, default: false).
    channel_size = 2048           # Tunnel channel size. Excess connections are discarded. Only for tcp and ws mode (optional, default: 2048).
    connection_pool = 8           # Number of pre-established connections. Only for tcp and ws mode (optional, default: 8).
    log_level = "info"            # Log level ("panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", optional, default: "info").
    heartbeat = 20                # In seconds. Ping interval for tunnel stability. Min: 1s. Not used in TcpMux. (Optional, default: 20s)
    mux_session = 1               # Number of mux sessions for tcpmux. (optional, default: 1).
    mux_version = 1               # TCPMux protocol version (1 or 2). Version 2 may have extra features. (optional)
    mux_framesize = 32768         # 32 KB. The maximum size of a frame that can be sent over a connection. (optional)
    mux_recievebuffer = 4194304   # 4 MB. The maximum buffer size for incoming data per connection. (optional)
    mux_streambuffer = 65536      # 256 KB. The maximum buffer size per individual stream within a connection. (optional)
    sniffer = false               # Enable or disable network sniffing for monitoring data. (optional, default false)
    web_port = 2060               # Port number for the web interface or monitoring interface. (optional, default 2060).
    sniffer_log = "backhaul.json" # Filename used to store network traffic and usage data logs. (optional, default backhaul.json)
    tls_cert = "/root/server.crt" # Path to the TLS certificate file for wss. (mandatory).
    tls_key = "/root/server.key"  # Path to the TLS private key file for wss.(mandatory).

    ports = [ # Local to remote port mapping in this format LocalPort=RemotePort (mandatory).
        "4000=5201",
        "4003", # Local and remote port are the same.
        "[4004:4006]", # port range. it's equal to "4004=4004", "4005=4005", "4006=4006"
        "[4007:4009]=5201", # port range. it's equal to "4007=5201", "4008=5201", "4009=5201"
        "4010:4019=5202", # without quate
    ]
    ```

   To start the `server`:

   ```sh
   ./backhaul -c config.toml
   ```
* **Client Configuration**

   Create a configuration file named `config.toml` for the client:
   ```toml
   [client]  # Behind NAT, firewall-blocked
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"  # Server address and port (mandatory).
   transport = "tcp"             # Protocol to use ("tcp", "tcpmux", or "ws", optional, default: "tcp").
   token = "your_token"          # Authentication token for secure communication (optional).
   keepalive_period = 20         # Interval in seconds to send keep-alive packets. (optional, default: 20 seconds)
   nodelay = false               # Use TCP_NODELAY (optional, default: false).
   retry_interval = 1            # Retry interval in seconds (optional, default: 1).
   log_level = "info"            # Log level ("panic", "fatal", "error", "warn", "info", "debug", "trace", optional, default: "info").
   mux_session = 1               # Number of mux sessions for tcpmux. (optional, default: 1).
   mux_version = 1               # TCPMux protocol version (1 or 2). Version 2 may have extra features. (optional)
   mux_framesize = 32768         # 32 KB. The maximum size of a frame that can be sent over a connection. (optional)
   mux_recievebuffer = 4194304   # 4 MB. The maximum buffer size for incoming data per connection. (optional)
   mux_streambuffer = 65536      # 256 KB. The maximum buffer size per individual stream within a connection. (optional)
   sniffer = false               # Enable or disable network sniffing for monitoring data. (optional, default false)
   web_port = 2060               # Port number for the web interface or monitoring interface. (optional, default 2060).
   sniffer_log = "backhaul.json" # Filename used to store network traffic and usage data logs. (optional, default backhaul.json)

   forwarder = [ # Forward incoming connection to another address. optional.
      "4000=IP:PORT",
      "4001=127.0.0.1:9090",
   ]
   ```

   To start the `client`:

   ```sh
   ./backhaul -c config.toml
   ```

### Detailed Configuration
#### Transport Protocols

You can configure the `server` and `client` to use different transport protocols based on your requirements:

   * **TCP (`tcp`)**: Basic TCP transport, suitable for most scenarios.
   * **TCP Multiplexing (`tcpmux`)**: Provides multiplexing capabilities to handle multiple sessions over a single connection.
   * **WebSocket (`ws`)**: Ideal for traversing HTTP-based firewalls and proxies.

#### TCP Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcp"
   token = "your_token" 
   channel_size = 2048
   connection_pool = 8
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```
* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcp"
   token = "your_token" 
   nodelay = true 
   ```
* **Details**:

   `remote_addr`: The IPv4, IPv6, or domain address of the server to which the client connects.

   `token`: An authentication token used to securely validate and authenticate the connection between the client and server within the tunnel.

   `channel_size`: The queue size for forwarding packets from server to the client. If the limit is exceeded, packets will be dropped.

   `connection_pool`: Set the number of pre-established connections for better latency.
   
   `nodelay`: Refers to a TCP socket option (TCP_NODELAY) that improve the latency but decrease the bandwidth

#### TCP Multiplexing Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcpmux"
   token = "your_token" 
   mux_session = 1
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```
* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:3080"
   transport = "tcpmux"
   token = "your_token" 
   mux_session = 1
   nodelay = true 
   ```
* **Details**:

   `mux_session`: Number of multiplexed sessions. Increase this if you need to handle more simultaneous sessions over a single connection.
   
   * Refer to TCP configuration for more information.


#### WebSocket Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
   transport = "ws"
   token = "your_token" 
   channel_size = 2048
   connection_pool = 8
   nodelay = true 
   ports = []
   ```

* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080"
   transport = "ws"
   token = "your_token" 
   nodelay = true 
   ```

* **Details**:

   * Refer to TCP configuration for more information.

#### Secure WebSocket Configuration
* **Server**:

   ```toml
   [server]
   bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8443"
   transport = "wss"
   token = "your_token" 
   channel_size = 2048
   connection_pool = 8
   nodelay = true 
   tls_cert = "/root/server.crt"      
   tls_key = "/root/server.key"

   ports = []
   ```

* **Client**:

   ```toml
   [client]
   remote_addr = "0.0.0.0:8443"
   transport = "wss"
   token = "your_token" 
   nodelay = true 
   ```

* **Details**:

   * Refer to the next section for instructions on generating `tls_cert` and `tls_key`.

## Generating a Self-Signed TLS Certificate with OpenSSL

To generate a TLS certificate and key, you can use tools like OpenSSL. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a self-signed certificate and key using OpenSSL:

### Step 1: Install OpenSSL

If you don't already have OpenSSL installed, you can install it using your system's package manager.

- **On Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install openssl
  ```
### Step 2: Generate a Private Key
To generate a 2048-bit RSA private key, run the following command:
  ```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
  ```
This will create a file named `server.key`, which is your private key.
### Step 3: Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the private key. This CSR is used to generate the SSL certificate:
  ```bash
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
  ```

You will be prompted to enter information for the CSR. For the common name (CN), use the domain name or IP address where your server will be hosted. Example:
```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Your Company Name
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:example.com
Email Address []:
```

### Step 4: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

Use the CSR and private key to generate a self-signed certificate. Specify the validity period (in days):
  ```bash
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt -days 365
  ```
This will generate a certificate named `server.crt`, valid for 365 days.
### Recap of the Files Generated:

* `server.key`: Your private key.
* `server.csr`: The certificate signing request (used to generate the certificate).
* `server.crt`: Your self-signed TLS certificate.

## Running backhaul as a service

To create a service file for your backhaul project that ensures the service restarts automatically, you can use the following template for a systemd service file. Assuming your project runs a reverse tunnel and the main executable file is located in a certain path, here's a basic example:

1. Create the service file `/etc/systemd/system/backhaul.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Backhaul Reverse Tunnel Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/root/backhaul -c /root/config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=1048576

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
2. After creating the service file, enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable backhaul.service
sudo systemctl start backhaul.service
```
3. To verify if the service is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status backhaul.service
```
4. View the most recent log entries for the backhaul.service unit:
```bash
journalctl -u backhaul.service -e -f
```

## FAQ

**Q: How do I decide which transport protocol to use?**

* `tcp`: Use if you need straightforward TCP connections.
* `tcpmux`: Use if you need to handle multiple sessions over a single connection.
* `ws`: Use if you need to traverse HTTP-based firewalls or proxies.
* `wss`: Use this for secure WebSocket connections that need to traverse HTTP-based firewalls or proxies. It encrypts data for added security, similar to WS but with encryption.
